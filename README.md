## üíº **Project Title:**

**Flexible Workforce Shift Planner**

---

## üìù **Project Description:**

The **Flexible Workforce Shift Planner** is a database-driven solution designed to manage and optimize workforce shift allocations across various departments within a company. This system allows for efficient storage, tracking, and assignment of employee work shifts based on individual preferences, departmental requirements, and shift availability.

This project ensures the removal of duplicate employee records, manages shift schedules, and links employees to their respective departments and preferred shifts. It utilizes SQL views for dynamic real-time visualization of shift assignments and supports both day and night shift allocations.

---

## üéØ **Objectives:**

* Eliminate duplicate employee entries using automated row filtering.
* Assign employees to their preferred shifts without manual mapping.
* Dynamically link employee data with their department and shift time.
* Provide clear visibility of shift distribution through views and queries.
* Ensure relational integrity with proper foreign key constraints.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Key Features and Functionalities:**

### 1. **Employee Deduplication:**

* Temporary employee data (with duplicates) is inserted into `employees_temp`.
* Duplicates are removed using `ROW_NUMBER()` with `PARTITION BY emp_id`.
* The most recent record is retained in the final `employees` table.

### 2. **Shift Management:**

* A dedicated `shift` table stores shift types like **Day shift** and **Night shift** along with their corresponding working hours.
* Employees are linked to shifts based on their **preferred shift** using dynamic SQL joins.

### 3. **Department Allocation:**

* The `departments` table lists various IT departments such as Software Development, Networking, etc.
* The `employeeDepartments` junction table connects employees to their specific departments using **foreign keys**, supporting many-to-many relationships.

### 4. **Shift Assignment:**

* A `shiftassignment` table records which employee is scheduled on which date.
* This structure helps in managing attendance and future shift planning.

### 5. **Dynamic View (Virtual Table):**

* The `shiftassignment_dynamic` **SQL view** merges employee data, shift details, and assignment records into a single dynamic view for reporting and real-time access.
* Helps HR or shift managers track who is working, on what shift, and when.

### 6. **Analytical Queries:**

* Aggregated queries provide insights such as:

  * Number of employees per shift.
  * Popularity of shift timings.
  * Department-wise employee strength.
  * Duplication count for quality checks.

## üîó **Entity Relationship Summary:**

| Entity                       | Key Fields              | Relationships                                      |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **employees**                | `emp_id (PK)`           | Linked to `employeeDepartments`, `shiftassignment` |
| **shift**                    | `shift_id (PK)`         | Linked via `emp_prefferedshift`                    |
| **departments**              | `dept_id (PK)`          | Linked via `employeeDepartments`                   |
| **employeeDepartments**      | `emp_id + dept_id (PK)` | Foreign Keys to `employees`, `departments`         |
| **shiftassignment**          | `assign_id (PK)`        | Foreign Key to `employees`                         |
| **shiftassignment\_dynamic** | ‚Äî                       | Virtual join view (employees + shift + assignment) |

---

## üìä **Sample Output:**

Dynamic view of all employee assignments:

```sql
SELECT * FROM shiftassignment_dynamic;
```

Displays:

* Employee ID
* Name
* Preferred Shift
* Shift ID & Time
* Assigned Date

---

## üìå **Advantages of the System:**

* Reduces manual shift allocation errors.
* Avoids duplicate employee data using SQL window functions.
* Real-time visibility via dynamic views.
* Supports scalability for more shift types or departments.

---

## ‚úÖ **Use Cases:**

* HR departments to plan flexible shifts.
* IT companies to manage rotating teams.
* Shift-based industries like BPOs or call centers.

---

## üßë‚Äçüíª Technologies Used:

* **SQL / MySQL** (Structured Query Language)
* **Views** for virtual tables
* **Window Functions** (`ROW_NUMBER()`) for deduplication
* **Foreign Key Constraints** for relational integrity
